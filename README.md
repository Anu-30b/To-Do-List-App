3) All the task are displayed in a card view.
4) User can eit the task by swiping the task to left side.
5) User can delete the task by swiping the task to the right with an alert box that asks for confirmation.

Tools used:
1) Android Studio - This is tool which helps the mobile developer to create mobile application and test them.
2) Java - I have coded the app using Java language.
3) SQLite - This is the databse which I used to store the task and for doing CRUD operations.

I have used Android Studio for the app development. I have installed it from the chrome. I have set it up with Android Virtual device.
As I wanted to test my app on the Andriod Virtual Device. First I need to add a virtual device in the Device Manager tab. Need to select the version and the model of the Andoird Virtual device.
After selecting the Android Virtual Device Now we need to click on the run app button to run our application so that it will create the Andoird virtual Device and the it will install the app in it.
The app we have developed will be opened Automatically.
