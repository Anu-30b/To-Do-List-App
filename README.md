To-Do List is an Android app that is used for the user to add their daily tasks. In this app, the user can add a new task, edit the existing task and delete a task.

To-Do-App functionalities:
1) The user can add the task a new task by clicking on the plus("+") icon at the right corner of the app.
2) The save button is enabled only when we type something as the title of the task.
3) All the tasks are displayed in a card view.
4) The user can edit the task by swiping the task to the left side.
5) The user can delete the task by swiping the task to the right with an alert box that asks for confirmation.

Tools used:
1) Android Studio - This is a tool that helps the mobile developer to create mobile applications and test them.
2) Java - I have coded the app using Java language.
3) SQLite - This is the database that I used to store the task and for doing CRUD operations.

I have used Android Studio for app development. I have installed it from the chrome. I have set it up with an Android Virtual device.
I wanted to test my app on the Andriod Virtual Device. First I need to add a virtual device in the Device Manager tab. Need to select the version and the model of the Andoird Virtual device.
After selecting the Android Virtual Device Now we need to click on the run app button to run our application so that it will create the Android virtual Device and it will install the app in it.
The app we have developed will be opened Automatically.
